# Calendar-System
This repo contains code written in the Autumn/Winter of 2016 as part of my Programming Paradigmes course at Aalborg University. The course required  multiple implementations of the same small program for generating an HTML representation of a calendar, each using a different programming paradigm.

For a functional implementation of the program I used the R5RS dialect of Scheme, and for a pure object oriented implementation I used the Pharo dialect of Smalltalk. I have included the code for both implementations, a descriptive report as well as an example of the html output :-)
